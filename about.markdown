I am a postdoctoral researcher in Anthropology at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona and a member of [GRAFO-UAB](https://webs.uab.cat/grafo/). I am currently working on the [MapCDPerNets](https://mapcdpernets.es) project. My work spans mixed methods, economy and markets, and culture and cognition. 

My doctoral research explored artisanal fishing communities in Chile, focusing on local markets, ecological knowledge, and resource management.
