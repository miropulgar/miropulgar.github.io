I am a predoctoral researcher in Anthropology at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona. I am a member of [GRAFO-UAB](https://webs.uab.cat/grafo/).

I am interested in mixed methodologies, economy and markets, culture and cognition, anthropology and sociology.

Currently, I conduct my research in artisanal fishing communities in Chile, focusing on local markets, ecological knowledge and management.
